# Public Folder - Background Image Setup

## Background Image for Login Page

To add a background image to the login page:

1. **Add your image file** to this folder with the name: `background-image.jpg`
2. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Size: 1920x1080 pixels or larger
   - File name: `background-image.jpg` (exact name required)

3. **Image suggestions:**
   - University/college campus photo
   - Abstract educational background
   - Professional gradient background
   - Any image that represents education/learning

4. **How it works:**
   - The image will be automatically displayed as the login page background
   - It will be resized to cover the entire viewport
   - A dark overlay will be applied for better text readability
   - The image will be fixed (won't scroll with the page)

## Current Files:
- `index.html` - Main HTML template
- `README.md` - This instruction file

## Note:
- If you don't add a background image, the login page will use a beautiful gradient background
- The background image will be loaded from the public folder at runtime
- Make sure the image file is named exactly `background-image.jpg`
- The current file is a placeholder - replace it with your actual image
- Recommended image size: 1920x1080 pixels or larger for best quality
